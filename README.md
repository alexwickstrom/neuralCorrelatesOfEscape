# escapeCircuits
Collections of scripts + functions to handle calcium imaging data from 4 types of behaviors.


Things contained on in this repo:

- SVMs for classification
- CNNs for classification
- Method(s) to remove units from analyses based on their correlation across recordings


HOW TO:

1. First, make sure to update the correct location of your data.
2. Replace `cellRegistered_093xx.mat` with the correct co-register `.mat` name.
3. Then you can just run each section in order.

Functions are defined at the end of each script.

DISCLAIMER:

Some of the code within each file are redundant; I'll get them cleaned up soon.
